Aim
Effective employee scheduling is vital for businesses in industries like retail, hospitality, healthcare, and manufacturing. Managing shifts, time-off requests, and employee availability is often a complex and time-consuming task that can result in scheduling conflicts, understaffing, or overstaffing if not handled properly. Project aims to address these challenges by providing an intuitive, cloud-based web application that automates and streamlines the employee scheduling process. The platform will allow managers to easily create, manage, and assign shifts, while enabling employees to request time off, swap shifts, and view their schedules in real-time from any device.

Objectives
1. To design and develop a Web-based scheduling platform, that allows managers to create and publish work schedules
2. To develop a mobile responsive interface to be able to use smartphones and tablets
3. To integrate analytics and reporting features to provide insights into employee costs and hours

Research Questions
1.	What can make online scheduling more efficient for managers and workers?
2.	How can shift swaps and scheduling conflicts best be resolved in real time?
3.	What types of design elements and functionality are perceived as most impactful by users in terms of improving engagement with mobile-responsive scheduling software?
4.	What kind of analytics will be most valuable in understanding trends in employee productivity and labour cost?

This project therefore bases its approach on employee scheduling combined with a mobile-responsive design with real-time conflict resolution, notifications, and analytics. A Django and PostgreSQL based ensures scalability and flexibility, which differ the platform from many of its existing solutions.
